# Workflow Inventory

Track every workflow in scope for this project.

| Workflow Name | Workflow ID | Purpose | Trigger Type | Schedule/Timing | Inputs | Outputs | Dependencies | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Example Workflow | REPLACE_ME | Short summary of what this does | manual / schedule / webhook / sub-workflow | e.g. daily 09:00 UTC | source payload/table/API | destination table/sheet/API | n8n nodes + external APIs | owner, SLA, caveats |

## Rules
- Keep this file updated whenever a workflow is added, renamed, deleted, or re-scoped.
- Include exact workflow IDs from n8n.
- Keep schedule and trigger details explicit (with timezone where relevant).
